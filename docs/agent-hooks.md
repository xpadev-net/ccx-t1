# Agent hook integrations

cmux uses agent hooks to show running state, Feed approvals, notifications, and to restore agent sessions after a normal app relaunch.

Claude Code is handled by the cmux Claude wrapper when Claude Code integration is enabled in Settings. Other agents are installed with:

```bash
cmux hooks setup
cmux hooks setup <agent>
cmux hooks setup --agent <agent>
cmux hooks uninstall <agent>
```

Supported agent names are `codex`, `grok`, `opencode`, `pi`, `amp`, `cursor`, `gemini`, `rovodev` (or `rovo`), `copilot`, `codebuddy`, `factory`, and `qoder`. `cmux hooks setup` skips agents whose binary is not on `PATH` and prints a summary.

## Integrations

| Agent | Binary checked | Installed file | Session restore | Feed bridge |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Claude Code | `claude` through wrapper | wrapper-injected settings | `claude --resume <id>` | PermissionRequest |
| Codex | `codex` | `~/.codex/hooks.json`, `~/.codex/config.toml` | `codex resume <id>` | PreToolUse, PermissionRequest |
| Grok | `grok` | `~/.grok/hooks/cmux-session.json` | `grok -r <id>` | PreToolUse |
| OpenCode | `opencode` | `~/.config/opencode/plugins/cmux-session.js`, `~/.config/opencode/plugins/cmux-feed.js` | `opencode --session <id>` | plugin event bus |
| Pi | `pi` | `~/.pi/agent/extensions/cmux-session.ts` | `pi --session <id>` | none |
| Amp | `amp` | `~/.config/amp/plugins/cmux-session.ts` | `amp threads continue <id>` | none |
| Cursor CLI | `cursor-agent` | `~/.cursor/hooks.json` | `cursor-agent --resume <id>` | beforeShellExecution |
| Gemini | `gemini` | `~/.gemini/settings.json` | `gemini --resume <id>` | PreToolUse |
| Rovo Dev | `acli` | `~/.rovodev/config.yml` | `acli rovodev run --restore <id>` | none |
| Copilot | `copilot` | `~/.copilot/config.json` | `copilot --resume <id>` | PreToolUse |
| CodeBuddy | `codebuddy` | `~/.codebuddy/settings.json` | `codebuddy --resume <id>` | PreToolUse |
| Factory | `droid` | `~/.factory/settings.json` | `droid --resume <id>` | PreToolUse |
| Qoder | `qodercli` | `~/.qoder/settings.json` | `qodercli --resume <id>` | PreToolUse |

OpenCode also supports project-local Feed installation:

```bash
cmux hooks opencode install --project
```

That writes `.opencode/plugins/cmux-feed.js` in the current directory.

## What the hooks record

Session hooks write `~/.cmuxterm/<agent>-hook-sessions.json`. Each entry stores the agent session ID, cmux workspace ID, surface ID, cwd, process ID when available, and a sanitized launch command. On app relaunch, cmux rebuilds each workspace and runs the agent's native resume command with the saved session ID.

The sanitizer preserves model, sandbox, config, and cwd-related flags. It drops prompts, credentials, old session selectors, and noninteractive commands so relaunch resumes the session instead of starting a new task or leaking secrets.

Grok uses its `Notification` hook for user-facing completion messages. cmux records `Stop` as idle state, but leaves the visible notification text to the `Notification` payload so repeated turns keep Grok's own message instead of a generic completion fallback.

## Custom surface resume commands

Use `cmux surface resume set --shell <command>` to attach a resume command to the current terminal surface. Public CLI and socket-created commands are kept for inspection and manual restore by default. To auto-run one on restore, approve the prompt or change its signed command prefix in **Settings > Terminal > Resume Commands**.

Approvals are prefix-based and signed by cmux. They also bind the working directory and exact environment values when present. A process can propose a command, but it cannot make that command sticky without the user choosing Auto-Restore or Ask Each Time in cmux.

## Disable automatic resume

To restore panes without automatically restarting saved agent sessions, turn off
**Settings > Terminal > Resume Agent Sessions on Reopen**.

You can also set the same preference in `~/.config/cmux/cmux.json`:

```json
{
  "terminal": {
    "autoResumeAgentSessions": false
  }
}
```

When this is off, cmux still restores the saved window, workspace, pane, scrollback,
and browser state. Restored agent terminals stay idle until you resume them manually.

## Environment overrides

| Agent | Config directory override | Disable cmux hooks for one process |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Codex | `CODEX_HOME` | `CMUX_CODEX_HOOKS_DISABLED=1` |
| Grok | `GROK_HOME` | `CMUX_GROK_HOOKS_DISABLED=1` |
| OpenCode | `OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR` | `CMUX_OPENCODE_HOOKS_DISABLED=1` |
| Pi | `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` | `CMUX_PI_HOOKS_DISABLED=1` |
| Amp | none | `CMUX_AMP_HOOKS_DISABLED=1` |
| Cursor CLI | none | `CMUX_CURSOR_HOOKS_DISABLED=1` |
| Gemini | none | `CMUX_GEMINI_HOOKS_DISABLED=1` |
| Rovo Dev | none | `CMUX_ROVODEV_HOOKS_DISABLED=1` |
| Copilot | `COPILOT_HOME` | `CMUX_COPILOT_HOOKS_DISABLED=1` |
| CodeBuddy | `CODEBUDDY_CONFIG_DIR` | `CMUX_CODEBUDDY_HOOKS_DISABLED=1` |
| Factory | none | `CMUX_FACTORY_HOOKS_DISABLED=1` |
| Qoder | `QODER_CONFIG_DIR` | `CMUX_QODER_HOOKS_DISABLED=1` |

Pi uses Pi's extension system, not the legacy Pi hooks API. The installed extension is auto-discovered from `~/.pi/agent/extensions/` or `$PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR/extensions/`.

## Troubleshooting

Run `cmux hooks <agent> install --yes` to reinstall one integration. Run `cmux hooks <agent> uninstall --yes` before editing generated files by hand.

If Feed shows nothing, confirm the terminal has `CMUX_SURFACE_ID` and the hook file contains a `cmux hooks feed --source <agent>` command or OpenCode feed plugin. Pi, Rovo Dev, and Amp currently provide lifecycle and restore hooks only, so they do not create Feed approval cards.

If relaunch does not resume an agent, check `~/.cmuxterm/<agent>-hook-sessions.json` for the saved session and verify the agent's resume command still works outside cmux.
