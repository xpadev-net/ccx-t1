# tmux Corpus Port Map

Pinned upstream tmux commit: `a9ba7b8ecbe1d107aa716f52d53c99ea1a00cf11`.

This map records how each selected upstream tmux regression or fuzz target is represented in cmux. It is documentation only; CI confidence comes from executable Go tests, Go fuzz targets, and the macOS terminal-renderer tests in `.github/workflows/tmux-corpus.yml`.
